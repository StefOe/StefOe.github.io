### Machine Learning for Spatio-Temporal and Multi-Modal Data on Land and at Sea  
I develop machine learning methods for analyzing and modeling spatio-temporal data from remote sensing and multi-sensor sources. My research focuses on the detection and assessment of environmental factors from diverse sources such as satellites and other Earth observation technologies. In addition to my marine research, I have extensive experience in terrestrial environmental monitoring, contributing to projects in forestry, agriculture, and peatland restoration.

### Solutions for Large, Unstructured Datasets and System Modeling  
In my work, I develop self-supervised learning methods and approaches to representation learning to make large volumes of unstructured, multi-modal data (e.g., images, point clouds, time series) accessible for analysis. Another focus is on hybrid modeling approaches that combine data-driven and hypothesis-driven methods to improve models and simulations of dynamic systems. I am also advancing resource-limited learning through knowledge distillation and dynamic data selection, particularly for data-intensive applications.

### Expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
