**Machine Learning for Spatio-Temporal and Multi-Modal Data on Land and at Sea**  
I develop machine learning methods for analyzing and modeling spatio-temporal data from remote sensing and multi-sensor sources. My research focuses on the detection and assessment of environmental factors from diverse sources such as satellites and other Earth observation technologies. In addition to my marine research, I have extensive experience in terrestrial environmental monitoring, contributing to projects in forestry, agriculture, and peatland restoration.

**Solutions for Large, Unstructured Datasets and System Modeling**  
In my work, I develop self-supervised learning methods and approaches to representation learning to make large volumes of unstructured, multi-modal data (e.g., images, point clouds, time series) accessible for analysis. Another focus is on hybrid modeling approaches that combine data-driven and hypothesis-driven methods to improve models and simulations of dynamic systems. I am also advancing resource-limited learning through knowledge distillation and dynamic data selection, particularly for data-intensive applications.

**Expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**

- **Spatio-Temporal & Multi-Modal ML:** I develop and apply machine learning methods for analyzing spatio-temporal and multi-modal information, including classification, segmentation, regression, drift, and anomaly detection.
- **Hybrid Modeling:** I integrate data-driven and hypothesis-driven approaches to enhance predictive accuracy and efficiency in dynamic systems and simulations.
- **Resource-Limited Learning:** I optimize model and data selection, as well as knowledge distillation, for efficient modeling in data-intensive applications.
- **Self-Supervised & Representation Learning:** I develop models that leverage unlabeled data and are refined with labeled data to enable more precise analyses.
