Hej,

I am a professor specializing in machine learning for spatio-temporal data, with a focus on environmental and marine applications. My research centers on:

- **Deep Learning for Spatio-Temporal Data:** Developing and applying advanced neural networks to analyze complex temporal and spatial patterns, particularly in remote sensing datasets.
- **Multi-Modal Representation Learning:** Integrating information from diverse sources (e.g., imagery, sensor data, simulation outputs) to build unified models that better capture real-world complexity.
- **Resource-Limited Learning:** Designing methods for efficient model training, including automated data selection and learning from limited labeled data, to maximize insight even when resources are constrained.
- **ML for System Modeling & Simulation:** Leveraging machine learning to create models that support simulation, prediction, and understanding of environmental and ecological systems.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between machine learning theory and impactful applications in Earth observation, environmental monitoring, and scientific discovery.
