abstract: 'Abstract          This study analyzes socio-economic demographics (including
  Geomatic conzoom® segmented demographic variables) as well as building and property
  registration information as risk factors in relation to the prevalence of residential
  building fires within 100 m × 100 m cells. The logistic regression model achieved
  a receiver operating curve (ROC) of 0.74 and a precision-recall curve of 0.12 on
  the testing dataset. The model identifies 19 significant variables related to the
  risk of residential fire. The top 5 highest performing variables in our model and
  their odds ratios are the following: number of people (OR 1.25), Multi/family residence-building
  type (OR 1.20), number of buildings (OR 1.18), conzoom® Type C—Country/Rural Communities
  (OR 0.85), construction year (OR 0.87). These results indicate that socio-economic
  factors play a large role in influencing fire vulnerability within residential areas
  and can help prioritize resource allocation to reduce fire vulnerability in the
  identified risk factor groups.'
